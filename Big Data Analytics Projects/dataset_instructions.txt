similarity, RMSE evaluation).

- Dataset name: MovieLens 100K
- Provider: GroupLens Research
- Official page: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/
- Direct download: https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip

- Description: 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies. Includes basic user
  demographics and multiple predefined train/test splits.

How to use with this repo:
1. Download ml-100k.zip from the link above.
2. Unzip into a local folder, for example:
   - data/movielens/ml-100k/
3. Update any config or paths in the notebooks/scripts (if needed) so they point
   to that folder.

Refer to the official MovieLens license and terms of use on the GroupLens site
before using the data.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. ENRON EMAIL DATASET (MAPREDUCE-STYLE TEXT PROCESSING)
------------------------------------------------------------

Used in: MapReduce-style text processing pipeline (batch accumulation, CSV spill,
top-K vocabulary extraction, tokenization/normalization/stop word removal).

- Dataset name: Enron Email Dataset
- Provider: Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
- Official page: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/
- Primary download (tar.gz): see the "Download" section on the page above
- Size: ~1.7 GB (compressed, depending on version)
- Description: ~500,000 emails from ~150 Enron employees, organized in folders.
  Widely used for email/text mining research.

How to use with this repo:
1. Visit https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/ and download the recommended current version
   of the corpus (tarred/gzipped archive).
2. Extract into a local directory, for example:
   - data/enron/
3. Update any config or paths in the notebooks/scripts (if needed) so they point
   to that folder.

Be sure to review and comply with the dataset’s license and usage restrictions
on the CMU page.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. OTHER DATASETS / SIMULATED ENVIRONMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------

Some projects (e.g., adversarial game AI using Expectimax search) may rely on:
- Provided course frameworks or game environments, or
- Synthetic / generated data

For these, refer to the specific project subfolder’s README or notebook for
details on how to run the code and any external dependencies. If the environment
or data is not publicly distributable, only the code and instructions are
included here.
